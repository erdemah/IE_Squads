    <h2>Minimum Wage</h2>
    <p>Certain employees may have different pay entitlements depending on whether they have a reduced work capacity because of disability, if they're under the age of 21 or if they are an apprentice or trainee.

    <h2>Pay Slips and Record-Keeping</h2>
    <p>In any business, large or small, record-keeping is vital to success.
        Record-keeping and pay slip obligations ensure employees receive correct wages and entitlements.</p>
    Check out the <a href="https://www.fairwork.gov.au/Pay/pay-slips-and-record-keeping/pay-slips">Pay Slips page</a> to learn what has to be included on pay slips and find our pay slip template. <br> <br> <br>
    <h3>Income Statements</h3>
    <p> There have been changes to the way some employers need to report payroll information to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
        This includes payments such as:</p>
    <li>salaries and wages</li>
    <li>pay as you go (PAYG) withholding</li>
    <li>superannuation information.</li>
    <p>This reporting change is called Single Touch Payroll (STP).</p> <br>
    <p> If an employer reports using STP, they don't have to give employees an end-of-year payment summary.
        An employee’s end-of-year payment summary - now called an income statement - will be available through their myGov account. <br>
